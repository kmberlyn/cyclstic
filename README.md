I anazlyzed a dataset using R fro Cyclstic, a bike-sharing company based in Chicago. I then created a Tableua dashboard with my findings. 

# background 
Cyclsitic is a fictional bike-sharing company who wants to increase their number of memberships. They were founded in 2016 and have grown tremendously since. They have over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. They set themselves apart by offering inclusive options for people with disabilities that can't use the two-wheeled standrad bike, options inlclude reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes. These bikes are able to be unlcoked in one station and returned to any other staion in the system.
